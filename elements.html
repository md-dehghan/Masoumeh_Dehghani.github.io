									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Hadamard.png" alt="" /></span> The spin-echo, full-intensity acquired localized (SPECIAL) sequence is a method for single-voxel, localized MRS in vivo with short TEs. In this study we modified the SPECIAL sequence to simultaneously record spectra from two volumes of interest. This new technique is called Hadamard-encoded dual-voxel SPECIAL (HD-SPECIAL).
                                    The HD-SPECIAL sequence enables reliable acquisition of MR spectra simultaneously from two regions at 3 T, offering the potential to study interregional variations in metabolite concentrations.</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/13Cglc.png" alt="" /></span> In 2004, Boumezbeur et al proposed a simple yet powerful approach to detect

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Lactate.png" alt="" /></span> <br />Lactate, a metabolic product of glycolysis and an intermediate in 
									the energy metabolism of carbohydrate‐consuming organs has been recently shown to play a criti- cal role in neuroplasticity

									for simultaneous neurochemical profiling in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the human brain at 7T, with a focus on the accuracy and precision
									of the lactate measurement. In addition, to correct for relax- ation effects on the lactate signal, T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> relaxation times of lactate were also measured.</p>

									spectroscopy employing a diffusion‐weighted stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) sequence at an ultra‐high magnetic field

									(MRS) combined with diffusion spectroscopy (DW‐MRS) allows for noninvasive investigation of the diffusion process of endogenous 
									molecules in the brain, and has the potential to shed insight into alterations of cellular restrictions experienced by metabolites,
									as well as the cellular compartmentalization of molecules in diseases. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to take advantage of the 
									remarkable sensitivity and spectral resolution of DW-MRS at 14T for a precise assessment 
                                    of diffusivities of abundant cerebral metabolites in healthy and shunt mice. </p>

									 Incorporating the maximum information available from in vivo localized <sup>13</sup>C spectra is of importance to get broader knowledge

									 amino acid neurotransmitters such as glutamate and glutamine using suitable mathematical models. The time course of multiplets arising
									 from <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>13</sup>C coupling between adjacent carbon atoms was expected to provide additional information for metabolic 
									 modeling leading to potential improvements in the estimation of metabolic parameters. The aim of the present study was to extend 
									 two-compartment neuronal/glial modeling to include dynamics of <sup>13</sup>C isotopomers available from fine structure multiplets in 
									 <sup>13</sup>C spectra of glutamate and glutamine measured in vivo in rats brain at 14.1 T, termed bonded cumomer approach.

									<h4><p href= "#">Ecole Polytechnique Federal de Lausanne</p></h4>
									
										<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is intrinsically interdisciplinary, embracing physics, mathematics, neuroscience and physical biochemistry.
										 As a field at the CIBM, NMR spectroscopy can be applied non-invasively to explore the metabolic fate of energy fuel substrates, as well as the rate at 
										 which they are consumed, using <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H nuclei. The work of this thesis encompasses both nuclei, 
										 and focuses on (1) improving the quantification and modeling of glucose-derived metabolites; and (2) 
										 characterizing diffusion-related parameters of the purportedly glial-specific energy substrate, acetate. 
										 Both aim to quantitatively explore cerebral energy metabolism, at ultra-high magnetic field, in vivo, in 
										 the healthy rat.  
										 13C NMR spectroscopy, as a tool, enables measuring the progressive incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C-glucose into 
										 brain glucose and then NMR detectable amino acids (glutamate and glutamine); this relies on the 
										 infusion of the  <sup>13</sup>C-labeled energy substrate. The experimentally obtained  <sup>13</sup>C labelling curves are 
										 analyzed using suitable mathematical models to provide an estimation of cerebral metabolic rates. Here, 
										 a dynamic model of time-courses of 13C multiplets arising from isotopomers was considered. So beyond 
										 the two-compartment neuronal-glial model, we took into account additional data on the dynamics of 
										 13C isotopomers, available from the fine structure multiplets in 13C spectra of glutamate and glutamine, 
										 measured under prolonged [1-6,<sup>13</sup>C] glucose infusion. We concluded that the dynamic analyses of <sup>13</sup>C 
										 multiplet time courses of glutamate and glutamine resulted in a higher precision for estimating the 
										 absolute values of most cerebral metabolic rates.  
									     Acetate metabolism is challenging because dynamic metabolic modeling requires prior knowledge of 
									     the transport and uptake kinetics of infused acetate. We sought this information by determining the 
									     apparent concentration and distribution volume (V<sub>d</sub>) of cerebral acetate between the intracellular and 
									     the extracellular compartments. Experimentally, the diffusion characteristics of cerebral acetate were 
									     measured,  relative  to  that  of  N-Acetylaspartate  (NAA,  known  to  be  mainly  intracellular)  using 
									     diffusion-weighted 1H NMR spectroscopy at 14.1T, under prolonged acetate infusion. The detection of 
									     an  acetate and  NAA  signal  at  large  diffusion  weighting  provided  direct  experimental  evidence  of 
									     intracellular cerebral acetate and NAA, although a substantial fraction of acetate was extracellular. To 
									     estimate the apparent concentration of in vivo brain acetate, T1 and T2 relaxation times of acetate were 
									     measured. The longer T1 relaxation and shorter T2 relaxation times of acetate compared with NAA 
									     provided  evidence  of  its  small  molecular  size,  and  possibly  different  chemical  environment.  Our 
									     experimentally determined value of V<sub>d</sub> led to cerebral metabolic rates of acetate (CMR acetate) of the 
									     same order reported for the glial Kreb’s cycle rate, an indication that estimates of CMR acetate are 
									     highly dependent on V<sub>d</sub>.   
									     Finally, in order to pursue metabolic mapping of cerebral acetate uptake in the rat, in vivo, at 14.1 T, 
									     the design and construction of a combined transmit-birdcage coil and receive-quadrature pair surface 
									     coil was considered. Its performance was compared to a single birdcage coil in the transmit/receive</p>
